# Cwill-Password-Generator

## Description
I wanted to make this project to test out how functions work together and try to write a full javascript by stringing them together.
I was able to try out new logic by implementing things i learned from class as well as external sources which helped me understand how to piece together
different aspects of the code and put them all together.This project was a lot of fun and it was nice to see it actually work once everything was finished.
